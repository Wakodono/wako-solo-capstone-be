/**
 * Overall flow
 * adminAuth middleware function is meant to handle authorization
 * Ok, we know that the request is authenticated but should we restrict
 * access to resources or possibility to edit resources?
 * Which resources specifically?
 * With the use of this function, we check if user role is certain.
 * If the user role (found within request.user) is admin in this case:
 * We call next() function. 
 * Request is allowed to proceed to another middleware for processing or
 * maybe controller function where some magic might happen on the database level.
 * 
 * If authenticated user role is not admin in this case, we want to run next function and provide http error as the argument for the function.
 * Response status will be 403:
 * "HTTP 403 is returned when the client is not permitted access to the 
 * resource despite providing authentication such as insufficient permissions
 * of the authenticated account."
